Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine producing tumours of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Similar catecholamine producing tumours of extra-adrenal chromaffin cells are known as paragangliomas. About 85% of pheochromocytomas arise from the adrenal medulla and about 15% arise from extra-adrenal chromafin cells [1]. Only few cases of pheochromocytoma in accessory adrenal glands have been reported in literature. We present a rare case of a patient with pheochromocytoma of an accessory adrenal gland.
